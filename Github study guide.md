1. Repository: Used to organize files in as single project. Other people’s repos be cloned for your own usage, this is called forking. They usually contain a README which contains info on the project.
	1. Creation of repo:
Write name. Then description. Then initialize with readme

2. Branching: There can be multiple branches stemming from the master branch of a file. The master branch is the main file. Branches take that main file so you can edit and make/experiment with new changes. Making a snapshot of master branch. Eventually, if you like your branch file, you can merge it with the master file thus having your master file contain all the stuff you created in the branch.

3. Commits: Commits are when you save/commit to something. Every time you commit something, you should write a message detailing the changes. To edit, click the pencil icon. After finishing, write the description. You’ll then commit this file to the branch you're working in. Unless you want to start a new branch. You can see in this branch that there are all your commits which enables you to go back to prior versions of a file.

4. Pull requests: You are proposing your branch changes to, most times, be pulled into the master branch. You can see the differences between the code the two branches have.
Now you can merge is there aren’t any problems. You can delete the branch now because all the changes have been incorporated into the master branch.
